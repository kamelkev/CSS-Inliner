NAME
    CSS::Inliner - Library for converting CSS <style> blocks to inline
    styles.

SYNOPSIS
    use CSS::Inliner;

    my $inliner = new CSS::Inliner();

    $inliner->read_file({ filename => 'myfile.html' });

    print $inliner->inlinify();

DESCRIPTION
    Library for converting CSS style blocks into inline styles in an HTML
    document. Specifically this is intended for the ease of generating HTML
    emails. This is useful as even in 2015 Gmail and Hotmail don't support
    top level <style> declarations.

METHODS
     new
        Instantiates the Inliner object. Sets up class variables that are
        used during file parsing/processing. Possible options are:

        entities - (optional) Pass in a string containing characters to
        entity encode in all output, overrides the internal default provided
        by the module

        html_tree - (optional) Pass in a fresh unparsed instance of
        HTML::Treebuilder

        NOTE: Any passed references to HTML::TreeBuilder will be
        substantially altered by passing it in here...

        strip_attrs - (optional) Remove all "id" and "class" attributes
        during inlining

        leave_style - (optional) Leave style/link tags alone within <head>
        during inlining

        relaxed - (optional) Relaxed HTML parsing which will attempt to
        interpret non-HTML4 documents.

        NOTE: This argument is not compatible with passing an html_tree.

        agent - (optional) Pass in a string containing a preferred
        user-agent, overrides the internal default provided by the module
        for handling remote documents

    fetch_file
        Fetches a remote HTML file that supposedly contains both HTML and a
        style declaration, properly tags the data with the proper
        characterset as provided by the remote webserver (if any).
        Subsequently calls the read method automatically.

        This method expands all relative urls, as well as fully expands the
        stylesheet reference within the document.

        This method requires you to pass in a params hash that contains a
        url argument for the requested document. For example:

        $self->fetch_file({ url => 'http://www.example.com' });

        Note that you can specify a user-agent to override the default
        user-agent of 'Mozilla/4.0' within the constructor. Doing so may
        avoid certain issues with agent filtering related to quirky
        webserver configs.

    read_file
        Opens and reads an HTML file that supposedly contains both HTML and
        a style declaration. It subsequently calls the read() method
        automatically.

        This method requires you to pass in a params hash that contains a
        filename argument. For example:

        $self->read_file({ filename => 'myfile.html' });

        Additionally you can specify the character encoding within the file,
        for example:

        $self->read_file({ filename => 'myfile.html', charset => 'utf8' });

    read
        Reads passed html data and parses it. The intermediate data is
        stored in class variables.

        The <style> block is ripped out of the html here, and stored
        separately. Class/ID/Names used in the markup are left alone.

        This method requires you to pass in a params hash that contains
        scalar html data. For example:

        $self->read({ html => $html });

        NOTE: You are required to pass a properly encoded perl reference to
        the html data. This method does *not* do the dirty work of encoding
        the html as utf8 - do that before calling this method.

    inlinify
        Processes the html data that was entered through either 'read' or
        'read_file', returns a scalar that contains a composite chunk of
        html that has inline styles instead of a top level <style>
        declaration.

    query
        Given a particular selector return back the applicable styles

    specificity
        Given a particular selector return back the associated selectivity

    content_warnings
        Return back any warnings thrown while inlining a given block of
        content.

        Note: content warnings are initialized at inlining time, not at read
        time. In order to receive back content feedback you must perform
        inlinify first
